# EMA-Diff

Package with EMA routines to calibrate Pilatus and obtain the diffratogram.

This package provides a set of the [EMA beamline](https://lnls.cnpem.br/grupos/ema/) (Extreme condition Methods of Analysis), specifically designed for calibrating Pilatus detectors and obtaining diffratograms. The EMA routines are implemented in a user-friendly and efficient manner, allowing researchers to easily analyze and interpret X-ray diffraction data.

Key features of this package include:
- Pilatus detector calibration: The package includes algorithms and functions to accurately calibrate Pilatus detectors, ensuring precise and reliable diffraction measurements.
- Diffratogram generation: The package provides tools to process raw diffraction data and generate high-quality diffratograms, which can be further analyzed and visualized.
- Customizable analysis: Researchers can easily customize the analysis process by adjusting parameters and applying specific algorithms to suit their experimental needs.
- Documentation and examples: The package comes with comprehensive documentation and examples to guide users in understanding and utilizing the EMA routines effectively.

To get started with this package, please refer to the installation instructions and usage documentation in the [documentation folder](/ema-diff/docs). Feel free to explore the provided examples to gain a better understanding of the capabilities and usage of the EMA routines.

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to further enhance and improve this package. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for new features, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.

Happy diffractogram analysis with the EMA package!
